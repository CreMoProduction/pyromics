# Pyromics Analytics and Usage Data Policy

This section of our Privacy Policy explains how the Pyromics Software uses third-party analytics tools to collect information about your use of the software ("Application Usage Data"). We use this information solely to measure usage, analyze trends, and improve the software's functionality and user experience.

## 1. Third-Party Analytics

We use an analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports application usage data. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of the Pyromics Software. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

As part of this service, we have implemented the following privacy-enhancing measures:

- **IP Anonymization:** GA4 is configured to anonymize IP addresses by default, meaning user IP addresses are not logged or stored.
- **Data Retention:** We only retain user-level data (such as app-instance IDs and cookie identifiers) for a maximum of 14 months before it is automatically deleted.
- **Consent Mode:** We utilize Google Consent Mode (or an equivalent Consent Management Platform) to ensure that GA4 tags only fire and collect data for users who have provided explicit consent for analytics and advertising purposes.

### 1.1. Types of Application Usage Data Collected by Google

The information collected by Google is primarily non-personally identifiable information, which helps us understand user behavior without directly identifying an individual. This includes:

| Category        | Specific Data Points Collected                                                                 | Purpose of Collection                                                                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Data  | Device type, operating system (OS) version, hardware information, software version, language settings | To ensure technical compatibility and optimize the software for the devices and operating systems used by our users. |
| Location Data   | Coarse geo-location data (Country, Region, City) derived from the anonymized IP address       | To understand the general geographic distribution of our users and localize content where necessary.    |
| Identifiers     | Pseudo-anonymous identifiers, such as a user ID (App-instance ID or Client ID)               | To distinguish unique users across sessions and devices for accurate reporting (e.g., counting unique installations). |

> **Note on Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**  
> We strictly prohibit the collection of PII, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers, as this is a violation of Google's Terms of Service and our commitment to your privacy.

### 1.2. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, we rely on the following legal bases for collecting and processing data:

| Processing Activity                        | Legal Basis (GDPR Article 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Setting Cookies/Identifiers                | **Consent (Article 6(1)(a))** – Required under the ePrivacy Directive. We obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before any non-essential analytics cookies or identifiers are placed on your device.                                             |
| Collecting and Analyzing Usage Data        | **Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f))** – We have a legitimate interest in analyzing data to measure the success of our Software and continuously improve it for the benefit of our users. This is balanced against the low risk to your rights, given our strong commitment to IP anonymization and minimized data collection. |
| International Data Transfer                | **Adequacy Decision (EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework)** – Data collected by Google may be transferred to Google LLC servers in the United States. Google LLC is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (or subsequent recognized transfer mechanism), which provides an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EEA and UK to the US. |
